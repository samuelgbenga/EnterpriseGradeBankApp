# Journey to Enterprise Banking App

---

## 1. ERD Diagram
* At this point, I am considering the ERD diagram and Schema Diagram.

---

## This is what would be needed:
To build a backend-only Enterprise Banking Application, you need to design services (business logic) that handle the core functionalities associated with the given entities. Hereâ€™s a list of required services and entities to guide you:

---

### 1. Entities (Based on ERD)
These are the core database entities youâ€™ll work with:

- **Bank**: Represents the overall bank.
- **Branch**: Represents different branches under the bank.
- **Transaction**: Stores all customer transactions (deposits, withdrawals, transfers, etc.).
- **Account**: Manages individual or joint customer bank accounts.
- **Loan**: Handles loans issued to customers, including repayment tracking.
- **Customer**: Represents bank customers, holding their personal information and linked accounts or loans.

Each entity will have its attributes, relationships, and CRUD operations in the backend.

---

### 2. Required Backend Services
Below are the services you should implement, categorized by functionality:

#### 1. **Bank Service**
- Register and manage banks.
- View details of banks and their associated branches.
- Update bank information (e.g., address, contact details).
- Delete banks (soft delete recommended).

#### 2. **Branch Service**
- Add and manage branches under a specific bank.
- Fetch branch details (e.g., branch code, manager info, location).
- List all branches of a specific bank.
- Update branch information.
- Delete branches.

#### 3. **Account Service**
- Open a new bank account for customers.
- Fetch account details by Account Number or Customer ID.
- Manage deposits, withdrawals, and transfers between accounts.
- Update account status (e.g., active, dormant, closed).
- Generate account statements.
- Calculate and manage account interest (e.g., for savings accounts).

#### 4. **Transaction Service**
- Process and record transactions (deposits, withdrawals, transfers).
- Assign a unique transaction ID for each operation.
- Retrieve transaction history for specific accounts.
- Implement pagination and filtering (e.g., by date, amount, transaction type).
- Handle failed transactions (rollback mechanisms).
- Monitor suspicious transactions (e.g., unusually large transfers).

#### 5. **Loan Service**
- Manage loan applications for customers (approval, rejection, or review).
- Fetch loan details (amount, interest rate, repayment schedule, and status).
- Handle loan repayments and update outstanding balances.
- Calculate loan interest and generate repayment schedules.
- Track overdue loan payments and generate alerts.

#### 6. **Customer Service**
- Manage customer registration, updates, and retrieval.
- Fetch customer details by Customer ID.
- Link customer details to accounts and loans.
- Verify customer identity (e.g., KYC - Know Your Customer).
- List all accounts and loans linked to a customer.

#### 7. **Notification Service**
- Send notifications (e.g., SMS/Email) for transactions, loan approvals, or repayments.
- Integrate notification templates (e.g., "Transaction Successful" message).

#### 8. **Audit/Reporting Service**
- Generate audit logs for transactions and account operations.
- Monitor user activities (for admins and users).
- Generate summary reports for branches, accounts, loans, and customer statistics.

### 3. Relations
- **Bank has Branches**:
    - **1 : N** â†’ One Bank can have many Branches, but one Branch cannot belong to multiple Banks.
- **Branch maintains Accounts**:
    - **1 : N** â†’ One Branch can have many Accounts, but one Account cannot belong to multiple Branches.
- **Branch offers Loans**:
    - **1 : N** â†’ One Branch can have many Loans, but one Loan cannot belong to multiple Branches.
- **Account held by Customers**:
    - **M : N** â†’ One Customer can have multiple Accounts, and one Account can be held by multiple Customers (e.g., joint accounts).
- **Loan availed by Customers**:
    - **M : N** â†’ One Customer can have multiple Loans, and one Loan can be jointly availed by multiple Customers.
- **Customer linked to Transactions**:
    - **1 : N** â†’ One Customer can have many Transactions, but a Transaction is associated with one Customer.

### 4. API Endpoints to Consider
Here are examples of endpoints youâ€™ll need:

#### **Bank**
- `POST /api/banks` â†’ Add new bank.
- `GET /api/banks` â†’ Get all banks.
- `GET /api/banks/{bankId}` â†’ Get bank details by ID.
- `PUT /api/banks/{bankId}` â†’ Update bank details.

#### **Branch**
- `POST /api/branches` â†’ Add a new branch under a bank.
- `GET /api/banks/{bankId}/branches` â†’ List all branches under a specific bank.

#### **Account**
- `POST /api/accounts` â†’ Open a new bank account.
- `GET /api/accounts/{accountNumber}` â†’ Get account details.
- `POST /api/accounts/{accountNumber}/deposit` â†’ Deposit into an account.
- `POST /api/accounts/{accountNumber}/withdraw` â†’ Withdraw from an account.
- `POST /api/accounts/transfer` â†’ Transfer between accounts.

#### **Transaction**
- `GET /api/accounts/{accountNumber}/transactions` â†’ Get transaction history.
- `GET /api/transactions` â†’ Fetch all transactions (admin access).

#### **Loan**
- `POST /api/loans/apply` â†’ Apply for a loan.
- `POST /api/loans/repay` â†’ Repay a loan.
- `GET /api/accounts/{accountId}/loans` â†’ Fetch customer loan details.

#### **Customer**
- `POST /api/customers` â†’ Register a new customer.
- `GET /api/customers/{customerId}` â†’ Fetch customer details by ID.
- `GET /api/customers/{customerId}/accounts` â†’ List accounts linked to a customer.
- `GET /api/customers/{customerId}/loans` â†’ List loans linked to a customer.
- `PUT /api/customers/{customerId}` â†’ Update customer information.

### 5. Tools and Frameworks to Use
- **Spring Boot**: For building REST APIs.
- **Spring Data JPA**: For database management.
- **Spring Security**: For user authentication and authorization.
- **JWT (JSON Web Token)**: For secure API access.
- **Hibernate**: ORM for entity persistence.
- **MySQL/PostgreSQL**: For database storage.
- **Swagger**: For API documentation.
- **Spring Validation**: To validate input data (e.g., valid account numbers).

By structuring your backend with the above services and entities, you will have a solid foundation for an Enterprise Banking System. If you need further elaboration on any particular service, let me know! ðŸš€
